M-N-Kappa is a free online moment curvature calculation tool. 

It is based on the moment curvature analysis method, which is used to determine the 
load-deformation behaviour of concrete sections based on non linear material stress-strain 
relationships.

A moment curvature diagram shows information about the bending stiffness of reinforced concrete
beams and the amount of nonlinear behaviour of a section. The nonlinear behaviour in reinforced 
conrete sections are:

* cracking of the concrete
* yielding of the reinforcement
* plastic deformation of the concrete
* crushing of the concrete

An example of a moment curvature diagram is shown below.
